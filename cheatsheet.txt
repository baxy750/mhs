MkDocs Site â€“ Local Workflow Cheat Sheet
========================================

Folder Structure
----------------
docs/           - Markdown content (.md files)
mkdocs.yml      - Site configuration (title, nav, theme, plugins)
_site_temp/     - Temporary build folder (autogenerated)
publish.sh      - Builds and publishes live site
serve.sh        - Runs local preview server
commitpush.sh   - Commits and pushes edits to main branch

Editing Content (Locally)
-------------------------
- Use a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code)
- All work is done offline
- Add Markdown pages in: docs/
- Update navigation in: mkdocs.yml under the "nav" section

Example mkdocs.yml snippet:

  nav:
    - Home: index.md
    - About: about.md
    - Week 1: week1.md

Preview Changes Locally
-----------------------
Run:

  ./serve.sh

Opens browser at:

  http://127.0.0.1:8000

The site live-reloads as you edit .md files.

Commit and Push to Main Branch
------------------------------
Run:

  ./commitpush.sh

- Adds and commits all local changes
- Pushes them to origin/main (GitHub)

Note: This does not update the live website

Publish to Live Site (GitHub Pages)
-----------------------------------
Run:

  ./publish.sh

- Builds site to _site_temp/
- Switches to gh-pages
- Overwrites old site with new content
- Pushes to origin/gh-pages

Live site:

  https://baxy750.github.io/mhs/

Example: Adding a New Page
--------------------------
1. Create: docs/about.md

2. Edit mkdocs.yml:

   nav:
     - Home: index.md
     - About: about.md

3. Preview locally:

   ./serve.sh

4. Commit:

   ./commitpush.sh

5. Publish:

   ./publish.sh

Other Notes
-----------
- _site_temp is kept after build so you can inspect it
- All work is done offline (no editing via the web UI)
- Use "git status" to check your working tree
- Always run commitpush.sh before publish.sh
- Note: sometimes you need to do:  git switch main  from bash to get back on the right place
